# Electric-Vehicle-Analysis-Dashboard


Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to analyze electric vehicle data, featuring key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total vehicles, average electric range, total BHEV vehicles, and the percentage breakdown of BEV and PHEV vehicles. 

Key components of the dashboard include:
- **Area Chart**: Displays total vehicles by model year.
- **Map Chart**: Visualizes total vehicles by state.
- **Dynamic Bar Chart**: Showcases the top N total vehicles by make, where N is user-defined (up to 15).
- **Donut Chart**: Represents total vehicles by CAFV eligibility.
- **Grid View**: Highlights the top 10 total vehicles by make.

Additionally, the dashboard includes filters for CAFV eligibility, EV type, model, and state. It offers dynamic interaction, where selections made within the dashboard update the data presented across all charts and views, enhancing the analytical experience.
